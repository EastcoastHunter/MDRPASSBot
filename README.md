# MDRPASS - Modern Day Role Play And Server Solutions Discord Bot
Submit a pull request if you want to add new features. I will most likely ask you to fix up some formatting/naming conventions ect, don't take it personally.

The bot Expects a file named `config.json` in its working directory. The file should look like this:
```json
{
    "token": "INSERTAPITOKENHERE",
    "gallery_url": "https://emilh.net/img/search",
    "disconnect_msgs": [
        "Bye bye, have a beautiful time!",
        ":wave:",
        "Please Notify The Bot Hoster for a Disconnection"
    ],
    "default_channel_id": "Your Default channel ID"
}
```
